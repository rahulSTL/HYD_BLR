SLD (Single Line Diagram) is a simple symbolic representation top view of highway with all the elements and objects on the sides of highway. Previously, we use to outsource this to some third party AutoCAD company. We created the images in-house using python. Whenever a person on the field fills a form data get stored in the database and an image based on all the input redeading entered by the user is prepared.
